                Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), motherboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, and computer case. It includes external devices such as a monitor, mouse, keyboard, and speakers.
                By contrast, software is a set of written instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware derived its name from the fact it is hard or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is soft because it is easy to change.
                Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist with only hardware.

                <h3>Computer architecture</h3>
                <p>
                    Computer architecture requires prioritizing between different goals, such as cost, speed, availability, 
                    and energy efficiency. The designer must have a good grasp of the hardware requirements and many different aspects of computing, 
                    from compilers to integrated circuit design. Cost has also become a significant constraint for manufacturers seeking 
                    to sell their products for less money than competitors offering a very similar commodity. Profit margins have also been reduced. 
                    Even when the performance is not increasing, the cost of components has been dropping over time due to improved manufacturing techniques that have fewer components rejected at quality assurance stage.

                <h3>Embedded systems</h3>
                <p>
                    Embedded systems have the most variation in their processing power and cost: from an 8-bit processor that could cost less than USD$0.10, 
                    to higher-end processors capable of billions of operations per second and costing over USD$100. 
                    Cost is a particular concern with these systems, with designers often choosing the cheapest option that satisfies the performance requirements.
                    Modern embedded systems are often based on microcontrollers (i.e. microprocessors with integrated memory and peripheral interfaces), 
                    but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, 
                    especially in more complex systems. In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in a 
                    certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand.
